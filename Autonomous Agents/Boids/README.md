Algorithm that models collective behavior of a group, using three  mains rules:
- Align
- Separation
- Cohesion

All three applied as a steering force on the subject, making the whole act as a group.

The "collective" implies in a behavior where a individual is affected by the movement of others, even if it is not in its immediate surroundings. With Craig reynold's algorithm this is the case!
