# Autonomous Agents

Series of codes on algorithms that define behaviors to be followed by our good agents! It mimics an inteligent agent by its independence on decision making (by the behaviors we thought it... not that it actually knows stuff lol)

### Boids
Three rules that model collective movement, by Craig Reynolds:
- Alignment
- Separation
- Cohesion

### Flowfield
Vector field applied as a force acting on vehicles.

Could be used **with** Boids algorithm. Why not both?

### Seek-Arrive
Simpler behavior than Boids.

Agent heads towards a target location and slow down as it get closer, until it stops on target.
