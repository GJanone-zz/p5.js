# Flowfield

The flowfield is a vector field in wich each vector works as a force acting on a body.

### The way of the Flow

To make an interesting vector field, it is a good choice to add some randomness to it. However, with each vector being generated from a random angle, the field ends up as a huge mess with vectors pointing in all directions, not giving a sense of  oriented flow.

**BUT** with the random angle being generated by a function like Perlin Noise, the randomness becomes "soft", where each individual vector has some proximity to it's neighbour. The consequence is that the field, as a whole, has a trend that gives some sense to it. 

*GIF here soon!*

It is good to notice that here we are using three axis of Perlin Noise:
- X and Y makes the rows and columns on the canvas
- The Z axis is trickier. It's slices are drawn on each step of animation, giving it a time property.

With three axis on noise(), we make a coerent field that moves with time!

### Optimizing

A vector field have, ideally, a vector attributed to every single point of the field. This means that for every pixel on the screen there is a vector to be calculated and updated, and this costs a lot.

**One Solution** is to scale down our canvas. Instead of having it full, we make chunks of pixels to work as a one single great pixel. The animation does not loose resolution, only the field.
